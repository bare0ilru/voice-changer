Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 is an anime series that deserves to be watched by any anime fan who appreciates quality storytelling, animation, and action. Whether you watch it online or download it via torrent files, you will surely enjoy this masterpiece of anime history.
  
If you are wondering what makes Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 so special and influential, here are some of the reasons why you should watch it:
 
- The story is engaging and unpredictable. Unlike many other mecha anime that follow a formulaic plot, Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 offers a complex and realistic portrayal of war, where both sides have their own motivations, ideologies, and flaws. The series also explores the psychological and moral dilemmas of the characters, who have to deal with the horrors and tragedies of war, as well as their own personal conflicts and relationships. The series is full of twists and turns, and does not shy away from showing the consequences of violence and death.
- The characters are memorable and relatable. Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 features a large and diverse cast of characters, each with their own personality, background, and development. The main protagonist, Amuro Ray, is not a typical hero, but a reluctant and inexperienced pilot who has to overcome his fears, doubts, and insecurities. The main antagonist, Char Aznable, is not a typical villain, but a charismatic and mysterious ace pilot who has his own agenda and secrets. The series also showcases the perspectives and struggles of other characters, such as the crew of the White Base, the Zeon soldiers, and the civilians caught in the crossfire.
- The animation is impressive and innovative. Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 may look dated by today's standards, but it was a groundbreaking work in its time. The series introduced the concept of "real robot", which means that the mecha are treated as realistic and practical machines that have limitations, damages, and maintenance issues. The series also used detailed and dynamic animation techniques to depict the mecha battles, which were thrilling and spectacular. The series also had a distinctive art style, designed by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and Kunio Okawara, that influenced many other anime works.

Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 is not a perfect anime series, as it has some flaws such as inconsistent animation quality, filler episodes, and rushed ending. However, it is a remarkable anime series that deserves respect and appreciation for its achievements and legacy. Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 is not only a great mecha anime, but also a great anime in general.
