You just need to plug them into a power source, connect them to your lights and to your computer or network, and assign them a unit ID using the Hardware Utility software. Then you can use the Light-O-Rama software to create sequences and assign channels to your controllers. You can also use the Hardware Utility software to test your controllers and lights, adjust the brightness and speed of your lights, and update the firmware of your controllers.
